= , +=, -=, *=, /=, %=, //=, **=, 

binary operation
-binary (bitwise and) &=    - binary (bitwise or) |= 
-binary (bitwise xor) ^=    - shifting to right >>=  - shifting to the lest <<=
example
binary 8 = 1000 
<<=3 then 8 which 1000 add  000  >>= then 8 which 1000 we move 1 three to right 0001 
1000000 binary 64                      = 1
