Life is full of routines. In programming we also do lots of repetitive tasks. In order to handle repetitive task programming languages use loops.

1 while loop
2 for loop

  # syntax
while condition:
    code goes here
else:
    code goes here

Break and Continue - Part 1
Break: We use break when we like to get out of or stop the loop.
# syntax
while condition:
    code goes here
    if another_condition:
        break

nested for loop
for key in person:
    if key == 'skills':
        for skill in person['skills']:
            print(skill)
