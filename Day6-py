Tuples
A tuple is a collection of different data types which is ordered and unchangeable (immutable). 
Tuples are written with round brackets, (). Once a tuple is created, we cannot change its values. 
We cannot use add, insert, remove methods in a tuple because it is not modifiable (mutable). 

tuple(): to create an empty tuple
count(): to count the number of a specified item in a tuple
index(): to find the index of a specified item in a tuple
operator: to join two or more tuples and to create a new tuple

tuple1 = (1,2,3)  tuple2 = (4,5,6)
len(tuple1)                # to know the length
tuple3 = tuple1 + tuple2   # to join to tuple
tuple_list = list(tuple3)  # change tuple to list
del tuple2                 # we can delete a single iteme but we can delete the whole tuple
