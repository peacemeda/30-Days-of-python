Set is a collection of unordered and un-indexed distinct elements. In Python set is used to store unique items, and it is possible to find the
union, 
intersection, 
difference, 
symmetric difference, 
subset, 
super set and disjoint set among sets.
` creating set
st = set()
methods 
  - .add()    - .update() list[] argument for multiple items
  - .remove() or discard() we use discard when we don't know if the item exist don't return error
  - .pop()  - .clear() to empty set  - del  
  - set3 = set1.union(set2)   - set3 = set1.intersection(set2)    - issubset()    -issuperset()
  - isdisjoint()
